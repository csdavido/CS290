			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<img src="me.jpg"/>
			<p><h5>My name is David Rider. I am a computer science student at Oregon State University. This website is the final project for the CS 290 web design course. I have learned a lot over the course of the semester, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL...lots of interesting things!</h5></p>
			<p><h5>I am really interested in network and IOT security. Almost every day in the news are stories of data breaches and compromised systems. We as CS students and professionals have a responsibility to code securely and follow best practices for mitigating risk. My goal is to work as a security engineer or penetration tester.</h5></p>
